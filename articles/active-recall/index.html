                <p>Have you ever noticed how information you’ve read minutes ago is easily forgotten? Have you felt like reading, note-taking, and highlighting – passive reviewing – are not enough for memorizing important things? Have you ever felt frustrated because you couldn’t remember answers to the questions? Then active recall is for you.</p><br>
                <h3>What is active recall?</h3>
                <p>Basically, active recall is a process of retrieving information from our memory. Our ability to retain information is boosted by the simple act of retrieving material from our brains, which also strengthens the links between various concepts in our brains. Active recall is a productive method of transferring knowledge from short-term to long-term memory so that you can quickly refer to it again when you need it. Many researches have shown how active recall is more effective than passive reviewing – in other words, better than reading, rereading, note-taking, and highlighting.</p><br>
                <h3>How to use active recall?</h3>
                <p>Okay, now the question is, how should we use active recall to memorize important information? First of all, read the topic of your choice and highlight needed details. Then, make questions regarding the topic and, lastly, answer these questions without looking up your book (or website, or presentation, or… you got it).</p><br>
                <h3>How to use flashcards in active recall?</h3>
                <p>Flashcards are great for practicing information retrieval (if not the best). Making flashcards for this process is fairly easy: just write down your question on the front side of the card and the answer on the back. Well done! Now you can pick up flashcards, read the questions, and try to answer them. If you think that you haven’t memorized properly, look at the back of the flashcard and read the answer. Put that card aside, review other flashcards, and pick that flashcard after several minutes.</p><br>
                <h3>Do not forget to combine active recall with spaced repetition!</h3>
                <p>With spaced repetition, you can make sure that key information sticks in your memory by going over them repeatedly at increasing intervals. For example, in the beginning, intervals are spaced close: you review information after one hour, then three hours, then the next day. As you review the information, intervals grow: now you have to review information after three days, then one week, then two weeks. Be aware that spaced repetition is a long term process, so you cannot use it one day before an important exam (... or you can, but your intervals will be very short, like 30 minutes, then one hour, then two hours, then three hours; you got the drill).</p><br>
                <h3>In conclusion…</h3>
                <p>Flashcards are powerful tools for memorizing! They are great for information retrieval (active recall) and spaced repetition. So go to our “Create flashcards” page and print them for free!<p>
