Hey Sholpan,

Let's keep README files on every update. So that each of us has idea on which part we are working right now. And in case we need the other person to do something, we can write it here.

1. I changed the account settings. Now we have "select file" button. However, I think it would be cool if you can change the style of this button. It looks ugly now ;)

2. Also, can we change settings div background? Probably it would be better if we have some solid background behind settings (when settings appear). Because you can't see clear border of settings' input areas by using ONLY blur.

3. Menu - I think we need minimum and maximum height

4.


Aidyn's notes:

1. When using the button clear from Write Page, need to make sure that elements from array will be deleted as well.
